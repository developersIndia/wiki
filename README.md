Welcome to the DevelopersIndia Community Wiki repository! This repository is
home for our face-lifted community wiki which you'll find across all the
platforms our community is active on. So, feel free to read through our wiki or
perhaps if you're interested in contributing to the project, this README will
come in handy for you.

## Contributing to the Wiki

We welcome community contributions to the project! And if you would like to
share a word or two which you believe will help the community achieve something
good, please read this section for instructions.

First off, we use the [`mdbook`][1] project to maintain, create & generate the
static version of our [wiki][2]. So, if you would like to get your hands dirty
with this project, make sure you've read the official `mdbook`
[documentations][3]. Besides the CLI tool, we also write our wiki content in
[GitHub Flavoured Markdown][4]. So if you need a run down on how to write in
Markdown, the [Markdown Guide][5] will be helpful for that cause.

That said, before contributing to the project make sure you've read & understood
the [contributing guidelines][6] for the community project. Once you have read
through it, please keep the following points in mind to create a wiki entry:

1. Ensure your wiki is comprehensive enough & benefits the community in some
   ways.
2. Ensure your wiki entry is thoroughly reviewed for correctness & quality from
   one of the moderators (_you can reach out to us over Discord_).
3. Follow the [issue][7] & [pull request][8] templates to create a wiki entry
   for the one of the moderators to review it. Expect the review process to take
   a while before it can be merged.

For a more in-detailed guide on contributing or creating community guide, refer
to the [contributing guidelines][10] document of the project.
