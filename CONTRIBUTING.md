# Contributing to developersIndia wiki

First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! ðŸŽ‰
Make sure you follow below guidelines before contributing.


## What qualifies as a "wiki"?

1. For starters, the wiki has 2 different sections:
   1. `Community Guides`: Guides which will help developersIndia (or the tech community) in general. You can suggest ideas by creating a proposal. A nice example would be _"How to improve your productivity as a developer"_. Go very niche with the topic.
   2. `FAQs`: Questions that are repeatedly asked on our subreddit (or discord). E.g _"How to prepare yourself for a product job"_ or _"How to switch from service based to a product-based job"_. FAQs are highly valuable to the community & we expect you to constantly update them as time changes.
2. We don't accept "tutorials" in the wiki.
3. Try to make you wiki as detailed as possible. We don't expect you to know everything.
4. Your intention while writing a wiki should be to think of the community as a whole.
5. Try to avoid any personal opinions. Try to be as close as possible towards facts.
6. Avoid touching any sensitive or debatable topics. A community wiki needs to be neutral. E.g. _Salaries_.



## Process of contributing a wiki

1. You create a wiki proposal with an intention to work on it.
2. Community Members review your proposal & ask/suggest any follow ups.
3. You take your time to write this wiki. We use markdown for writing and vale for prose linting.
4. You create a PR mentioning the issue no.
5. One (or more) community members from our team reviews your Wiki. You fix any issues (grammar etc)
6. Once the PR is merged. We announce the new wiki addition on our subreddit (and discord).
