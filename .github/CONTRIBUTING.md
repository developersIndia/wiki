# Contributing to the Community Wiki

Each & every project we build and/or maintain has been a possibility due to the
community member efforts. Without which the projects would've been a distant
dream only! As such, while we welcome all sorts of contributions to developing
our community website, we ask the contributors to abide by certain rules &
guidelines. These guidelines help us ensure:

1. Development practices are uniform.
2. Bug reports follow a standard procedure which makes it easier to debug &
   resolve certain issues quicker.
3. Submitting bug fixes, patches, feature requests through [Pull Requests (PRs)][1].
4. The details & examples to share when proposing a new wiki entry.

As such this current document lists down such guidelines in complete detail
which every contributor should follow while contributing to the project.

Do note, the statements detailed in this document aren't set in stone &
individual contributors are expected to use their best judgement when
developing and/or contributing to the project. And if you feel, certain
portions of this document could use a rephrasing? Please do not hesitate
to report it to us & open a PR referencing it!

## Code of Conduct

First of, our community welcomes people from all sorts of areas & expertise with
varying years of experience. As such we ask you to be civil when interacting
with another community be it on GitHub or elsewhere.

To enforce a civil & mature engagement among community members we drafted the
[Code of Conduct][2]. If you find anyone breaking the T&Cs of the aforementioned
document please report us about the incident on over our email -
`contact.developersindia@gmail.com`.

## Too Long, Didn't Read, But I've a Question

> **Note:** [Please don't file an issue to ask a question.][3] You'll get faster
results by using the resources below.

- Check the [Issue][4]/[Discussion][5] threads to see if your query already
  exists or not!
- If it's a quick short answer which you believe one of the admin/maintainers
  can respond to real quick, our DMs are open to you.
- Join our [Discord server][6] & have a great chat there! (**Don't forget to
  read the rules & guidelines there as well!**)

## How to Contribute to the Project

### Report Grammar/Spelling Issues Using GitHub's Issue Tracker

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs, weird features, broken URLs & such.
More specifically, any thing out of the ordinary which shouldn't really exist
in a website is tracked on our bug tracker.

You can report a bug by [opening a new issue][7], it's that easy! But before
reporting an issue, please put in some effort & identify if similar reports
have already been created by a previous individual.

> **Note:** If you find a **Closed** issue that seems like it is the same thing
that you're experiencing, open a new issue and include a link to the original
issue in the body of your new one.

### Before Submitting a Bug Report

- Check if the content is being delivered to your browser. Sometimes a quick
  Hard Refresh(**Shift + Ctrl + R**) might resolve the issue.
- Determine if such a bug report has already been reported earlier or not.
- Take a screenshot of the bug if possible & take note of the Browser details.

### How to Submit a Good Report

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- **Use a clear & descriptive title** to identify the issue & for obvious SEO
  reasons.
- **Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem** in as many details as
  possible.
- **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**. Include links to files
  or GitHub projects, or copy/pasteable snippets, which you use in those
  examples. If you're providing snippets in the issue, use [Markdown code
  blocks][[8].
- **Describe the behaviour you observed after following the steps** and point
  out what exactly is the problem with that behaviour.
- **Explain which behaviour you expected to see instead and why.**
- **Include screenshots and animated GIFs** which show you following the
  described steps and clearly demonstrate the problem. If you use the keyboard
  while following the steps, **record the GIF with this tool**:
  [ShareX][9].
- **If the problem wasn't triggered by a specific action**, describe what you
  were doing before the problem happened and share more information using the
  guidelines below.

Project maintainers & authors _love_ thorough bug reports!

### Suggesting Enhancements

All projects maintained under the [developersIndia][10] banner are FOSS & as
such welcomes public opinion on features & enhancements! And this section of the
document will help you understand how to draft a detailed enhancement
suggestion. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community
understand your suggestion :pencil: and find related suggestions :mag_right:.

Before creating enhancement suggestions, please check [this list][11] as you
might find out that you don't need to create one. When you are creating an
enhancement suggestion, please [include as many details as possible][12].
Fill in [the template][13], including the steps that you imagine you would take
if the wiki entry you're requesting existed.

### Your First Code Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing to the project? You can start by looking
through these `good-first-issues` and `help-wanted` issues:

- [Good First Issues][14] - issues which should only require a few lines of
  code, and a test or two.
- [Help Wanted Issues][15] - issues which should be a bit more involved
  than `good-first-issues` issues.

Both issue lists are sorted by the total number of comments. While not perfect,
the number of comments is a reasonable proxy for an impact a given change will have.
