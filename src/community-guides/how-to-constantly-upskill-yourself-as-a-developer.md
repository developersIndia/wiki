## Hangout in Forums & Communities

- Choose a community with which you can resonate. By community, we mean a collection of self-motivated developers/engineers/programmers. You are already in the right place 😉.
- Read and watch what people are asking and discussing.
- A good example is reading questions on [stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com) or [Software Engineering - StackExchange](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/?tab=month).
- Join programming-related subreddits (Reddit is the best place for software folks after Stack Overflow). If you like JavaScript, [find subreddits related to JavaScript](https://anvaka.github.io/sayit/?query=javascript) and join them.

## Write Code & Create Software Projects

- This has been asked and repeated thousands of times by everyone on the internet: Just build stuff!
- Learn how to contribute to FOSS if you don't have your own ideas to build.
- Constantly learning new stuff is useless if you can't apply those new techniques.

## Write about what you learn

- No matter how small things are, if they are forgettable (and most things in software are), then log them somewhere.
- Build a notes site just for yourself; it doesn't need to be fancy. Open a text file, write about what you learned, and store it in a git repo or in Google Docs.
- Optionally, you can choose to share your knowledge with the rest of the world via blogs.

## Where to find interesting stuff?
