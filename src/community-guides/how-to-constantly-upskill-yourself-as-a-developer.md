# How to Constantly Upskill Yourself

## Hangout in Forums & Communities

- Choose a community you can resonate with, by community we mean a collection of self-motivated developers/engineers/programmers. You are already at right place ðŸ˜‰.
- Read and watch what people are asking and discussing about
- A good example is reading questions on [stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com) or [Software Engineering - StackExchange](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/?tab=month).
- Join programming related subreddits (Reddit is the best place for software folks after StackOverflow). If you like JavaScript, [find subreddits related to javascript](https://anvaka.github.io/sayit/?query=javascript) and join them.

## Write Code & Create Software Projects
- This has been asked & repeated thousands of time by everyone on Internet, Just build stuff!
- Learn how to contribute to FOSS, if you don't have ideas yourself to build.
- Constantly learning new stuff is useless if you can't apply those new techniques.

## Write about what you learn
- No matter how small things are if its something forgettable (and most of the things in software are) then log it somewhere.
- Build a notes sites just for yourself, no need to be fancy. Open a text file, write about what you learned, store in a git repo or in google docs.
- You can optionally choose to share you knowledge with the rest of the world via blogs.
