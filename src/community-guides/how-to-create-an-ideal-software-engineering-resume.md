# Guidelines on Creating an Ideal Software Engineering Resume


If you ever looked for job before, you would know job hunting is no walk in the park. It's stressful, time consuming and chances of you landing a job after hundreds of applications is less than 5%! 

This is so because recruiters and companies receive hundreds if not thousands of applicants. And businesses would **ALWAYS** prefer optimising their operations wherever possible. Suffice to say, it's paramount to be on top of your toes when it comes to grabbing the recruiter’s attention.

There're a couple of tasks you can work on to increase you chances of successfully landing a job (like [preparing for DSA](https://www.reddit.com/r/developersIndia/w/faq/how-to-start-dsa/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app) & interviews). But all those tasks are pretty useless if your resume isn't optimised enough to pass the first few hurdles (like the Application Tracking System (ATS)).

So, here are some tips to make your resume optimised & perfect for what the recruiters are looking for. 

## Use the Right Format

I'm sure you must've stumbled across countless resume templates out in the wild! Be it Google Docs, MS-Word Document Templates, heck even [Canva](https://canva.com) and/or the random “[resume generators](https://www.google.com/search?q=resume+generators&oq=resume+generators&aqs=edge..69i57j0i433i512j0i20i263i512j0i512l6.2677j0j1&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8)” that promises to create aesthetically pleasing resumes for you. Unfortunately, if you ever used one of those templates, rest assured your resume won't be parsed properly in an ATS (unless lady luck herself is on your side!).

Your ideal ATS-friendly resume will:

1. Be in a single column format, to be read top to bottom, left to right. Similar to reading any other LTR languages (like English). 
2. Not abuse unnecessary whitespaces (as fellow software engineers, we all know computers don't interpret whitespaces the same way humans do). 
3. Be sectioned properly with well-formatted, distinct & self-explanatory headings.
4. Categorically ordered so as the ensure the recruiter focuses more on the sections you want to prioritise (like the “*Experience*” or “*Technical Skills*” section).

## Giving the Resume a Professional Look

While the format and structure of the resume is only half the task, making it both appealing to look at & legible is equally important! Do note, if the resume passes the ATS hurdle, the resume now needs to pass the “*recruiter approval*” hurdle! So, let’s see how should we make a resume which is both ATS-friendly & liked by technical recruiters alike.

Remember, Technical Recruiters more often than not don't care about the design of your resume. So yeah that Canva resume template you've been looking at? Yeah the one with exotic fonts and rainbow colours? You can ditch it, a prospective technical recruiter doesn't want to gauge your design prowess. They want to know how capable you're at what you do! 

And the best way to showcase those factors are as follows:

1. Use a simple Sans Serif font & overlook any other nonsense fonts for professional documents. I **CANNOT** emphasise on this factor enough!
2. Use power words & quantify your past contributions to a project/company/business. It gives an impression of someone who is capable of holding a professional demeanour where & when necessary as a Software Engineer. Also the numbers describing your past responsibilities simply gives out a sense of specificity in the prospect’s point of view which is always good.
3. Format the sections of the resume with bold fonts, capitalised first letter of each word & an underline (with a visible thickness). 

## Things to Include in the Resume

Now it's understandable, if you want to grab someone's attention, it's natural to showcase everything you're good at! But that natural human instinct does more harm than good in today's fast-moving corporate scenario.

So first off, no, you don't need a 4-page long resume. A single page (and less than two & a half) is **MORE** than enough. You should go for a 2-page long resume **ONLY** if boast of decades of experience!

Suffice to say, there's only so much available real estate in standard single `A4` sized paper. And being able to stuff enough information about yourself in that size paper will be a matter of how successful the resume is. 

So to optimise our limited resource, we'll only include the most relevant information in the resume. And here are bit of what “relevant info” is like:

1. The list of your “*Technical Skills*” and I prefer categorising them further like React.js under “*Libraries & Frameworks” and so on…* 
2. Your past “*Experience*” with quantified descriptions of the past responsibilities as detailed in a previous section. Don't forget to make ample use of power words to showcase confidence & an image of a “*dependable individual*”.
3. A list of projects & I prefer naming this section as “*Portfolio*” since there're times when a company might've funded a project where your initial contributions were the foundational base. But you don't own the IP rights to the project. And in renaming the section you can also include your personal projects without creating a separate section! That said, as is usual, don't forget to quantify your responsibilities & use enough power words.

## Prioritise Categories as per the Importance

In a previous section I briefly mentioned about categorising the sections of a resume according to its priority & importance. For example, an experienced individual **SHOULD** start (*after the header section which usually contains your name & contact details*) the resume describing their past experience. The “*Experience*” section can be immediately followed by the “*Projects*” (I prefer naming it as “*Portfolio*” see justification for doing so above) & then “*Skills*”*, “Education”*, etc.

On that note, following are some quick notes on how you should prioritise the categories:

1. You’re an experienced individual (*as in someone with 1+ years of experience*) in that case its best to start the main section of the resume with either the “*Technical*” *or “Experience”* sections. In doing so, you ensure the prospect is forced to focus more time on those two sections than the rest of the stuff towards the end of the resume.
2. Be mindful, human beings have short attention span & especially in today’s fast-moving world, you’ll want to attract someone’s attention as quick as possible all the while being **VERY** specific. So, only include necessary information about yourself before filling up whitespace with fluff.
3. There will be times (*especially as a fresh college graduate*) when say, looking for an internship or an apprenticeship, your “*Experience*”  and/or “*Technical*” section wouldn’t be as impressive as someone with years of experience. In that case, start the resume with an “*Education*” section & detailing “*relevant courses*” which you believe will help the prospect in their businesses. For example, if you’re applying to a Machine Learning position, state relevant coursework like Statistics & such which were taught in your college curriculum.

That said, do remember prioritising what to include towards the top of the resume is a subjective topic. You can never go wrong with what you include in the resume but remember, relevancy is more important than simple fluff! 

## Recommended Resources for Reference

The suggestions I shared above are only the tip of an iceberg & there's so much more involved in what makes your resume truly stand out. I do plan on requesting to the mods for pinning this thread as a wiki input. But I plan on maintaining a more up-to-date version of this discussion on [a separate note](https://www.notion.so/Guidelines-on-the-Ideal-Software-Engineer-s-Resume-6c3a24a33e964b37a4b8992bdcdf27b1), so feel free to check it out if you want to.

That said, while following these suggestions will help you build the base of a good resume, you should receive some second-hand feedback for further polishing. So, to end this thread, let me share some resources which you can use to polish your resume further:

1. Use a LaTeX template to generate the PDF of your resume. A good starting point is [Jake’s](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/jakes-resume/syzfjbzwjncs) or [Sourva Bajaj’s](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/software-engineer-resume/gqxmqsvsbdjf) resume & rest assured your resume will easily pass the ATS-check. Using a pre-made template will also save time & effort!
2. Get your resume reviewed from your peers. A second opinion will always polish out the remaining intricate mistakes here and there which you might've missed. Join [our Discord community](https://discord.gg/kRMQSZGzkt) & ping me whenever you want to for a resume review (my Discord ID - `Jarmos#8937`).
3. **ALWAYS** remember, job hunting is a numbers game! Don't lose patience and keep applying to jobs on all platforms you can think of. And don't hesitate to reach out to prospects & network with people. Be mindful though, asking for a job straight away might appear rude to some. See this article - ****[How to Break Into the Tech Industry—a Guide to Job Hunting and Tech Interviews](https://haseebq.com/how-to-break-into-tech-job-hunting-and-interviews/)**** to find some insights & lessons. Also ensure you give a second look at the resume for grammatical errors or update the keywords before sending it to a prospects. You never know what sort of an impression would that last minute update leave on the prospect!
4. Read the blog - “[Why I do my resume in LaTeX](https://www.toofishes.net/blog/why-i-do-my-resume-latex/)” & its the [HN thread](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2238408) for further insights on writing good ATS-friendly resumes.
