## Stories from the community

`u/Luci_95` on a post titled [Switching from Software Developer to DEVOPS role](https://www.reddit.com/r/developersIndia/comments/1fjk7h5/switching_from_software_developer_to_devops_role/) shared the following story:

<blockquote>

Switched from backend dev to SRE/Devops role now I'm back in dev.

Nothing concrete for the roadmap, but i polished my linux stuff. Unix and Linux system administration handbook helped quite a bit. The firm was using aws at that time with a few configuration management tools. Learnt ansible and puppet to automates stuff. Monitoring tools like prometheus grafana basics of alertmanager. Also brushed up my docker stuff later adding k8s to my knowledge base. It was more than sufficient for the role that was needed.

Didn't have any prior experience as a devops engineer but I was already containerizing my apps and deploying them on dev environments with proper network and internal dns configurations so that was already helpful. Worked in devops/sre for around 2.5 years post the transition

WLB would depend on the company and how many services you are running. I added a decent amount of alerting to the services and the high priority ones always needed some attention but then it would also depend on the app you're running and how robust it is. Most escalations were due to minor miscommunications like some environment variables missing and what not.

TL;DR I took up the role to be an actual fullstack dev in terms of coding from scratch till deploying on prod. I think it's a skill every dev should have or experience at least once.
