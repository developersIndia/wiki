## Perspectives & advice from the community

### Long Term Career Planning

`u/impossible__dude` on a post titled
[What is the future of people in the tech sector?](https://www.reddit.com/r/developersIndia/comments/18ma6fw/what_is_the_future_of_people_in_the_tech_sector/)
shared the following advice:

<blockquote>

I am 45, working as a CXO in a mid sized firm (1000+ staff).

Here are a few things that worked for me:

Planning about the future makes no sense, we dunno if we will be alive next
week. Why think of 30 years ahead and bug yourself.

Have money goals. Say how much do you think you need to run a family? If your
household expenses are 1 lac pm, then a good first target is 2.4cr (annual
expenses x 20). Work on it

Acquire skills. Whatever be your area acquire skills that speak for you. Build
something useful for others, have a strong github presence. Contribute to open
source, that's a very strong skill there

Don't look around and see who is doing what and compare. Then you are trying to
be another rat in the rat race, and except for stress never gives anything back
this approach

Strongly refrain from using social media. If you must, use it for brand building
but please use it judiciously. Much of social media is fake, toxic and always
ready to weave a conflicting narrative. Very bad for the brain. If you want a
long career you need to be healthy and relaxed above anything
