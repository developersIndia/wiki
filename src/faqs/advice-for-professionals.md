## Perspectives & Advice from the community

### Long Term Career Planning

`u/impossible__dude` on a post titled [What is the future of people in the tech sector?](https://www.reddit.com/r/developersIndia/comments/18ma6fw/what_is_the_future_of_people_in_the_tech_sector/) shared the following advice:

<blockquote>

I am 45, working as a CXO in a mid sized firm (1000+ staff).

Here are a few things that worked for me:

Planning about the future makes no sense, we dunno if we will be alive next week. Why think of 30 years ahead and bug yourself.

Have money goals. Say how much do you think you need to run a family? If your household expenses are 1 lac pm, then a good first target is 2.4cr (annual expenses x 20). Work on it

Acquire skills. Whatever be your area acquire skills that speak for you. Build something useful for others, have a strong github presence. Contribute to open source, that's a very strong skill there

Don't look around and see who is doing what and compare. Then you are trying to be another rat in the rat race, and except for stress never gives anything back this approach

Strongly refrain from using social media. If you must, use it for brand building but please use it judiciously. Much of social media is fake, toxic and always ready to weave a conflicting narrative. Very bad for the brain. If you want a long career you need to be healthy and relaxed above anything
