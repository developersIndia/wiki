# Negotiating Notice Periods

`u/dedxtreme` on a post titled [Lied about my Notice period before interview now f**ked](https://www.reddit.com/r/developersIndia/comments/1b875sd/lied_about_my_notice_period_before_interview_now/) shared the following advice:

<blockquote>

Tell the recruiter that you have a good working relationship with your current manager and that he’s requesting for 45-60 days to ensure smooth transition. Tell that he wanted to retain you with salary revision but you refused as you’ve decided to move on. So, out of kindness for his gesture you’d like to complete the transition the way he has requested.

This shows that you’re definitely going to leave the current org and not stay back, you’re a nice person work with even when parting ways, and that you have a good work ethic that you put ppl first. The recruiter and more so the new hiring manager would appreciate this.

This has helped me in the past when I wanted a couple of weeks of breathing time before I switch to a new org.
