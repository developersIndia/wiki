# Choosing your new workplace

## Perspectives & Advice from the community

_@someguyguy._ on developersIndia discord shared the following advice on **How to evaluate if a good company is _good_**?

<blockquote>

1. Check the product they are building, is it good enough? Do you feel it could be successful?
2. Checkout linked in profiles of co founders, senior tech and junior tech people as well? Also of other senior members. Are they good?
3. Check their funding? Which stage of funding are they in? Who are their investors? Check out their profile on crunchbase.
4. Are you interested in the industry they are working in? Is it exciting/interesting/innvoative/etc.?
5. What is their tech stack? What is the level of their backend infra? Are they using a custom built framework/library?
6. What is their interview process like? Too easy? 
7. Check out their profile on glassdoor, how many bad reviews there are?
8. Try to connect on Linkedin with an ex employee and ask about their experience.
9. What are their coding practices? Do they write unit tests? Do they follow TDD? Do they have an in-depth code review process?
10. How many techies are there in the company relative to business/marketing/etc. people? Is the company focusing on creating an interesting tech product or just selling a subpar product?
11. Do their co founders have experience in starting companies? Where are those companies now? How long did they last?
12. Ask about their roadmap. What are they focusing on?
13. How much are they paying? How much are they paying senior tech people(checkout angel or job postings on other websites)? How much ESOPS do they give to junior/senior people?
14. Ask about their focus on work life balance.
15. What is their team size right now and how much would it be 6 months/1 year from now?

Also be careful asking questions. I have seen some people who would not like someone joining their team asking about funding etc. The reality is that you would not be able to find answers to all of these questions but try to find as many as possible.

No company would have positive answers on all of these. Find the ones which have good/great answers on most of these questions.
