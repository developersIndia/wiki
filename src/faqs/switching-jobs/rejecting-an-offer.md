# Rejecting an offer


## Perspectives & Advice from the community

_u/Mindless-Pilot-Chef_ on a post titled [I accepted an offer but don't want to join](https://www.reddit.com/r/developersIndia/comments/taw6k8/i_accepted_an_offer_but_dont_want_to_join/) shared the following advice:

<blockquote>

Just drop a formal email/talk to the HR, something along these lines: Hey, thank you so much for offering me the job for the position X, but recently I have been made another offer which, after careful consideration, is what I will be going forward with. Therefore, I would like to forfeit the offer from your organization. This is purely because I feel that the other offer is more aligned with my short and long term career aspirations. I deeply regret any inconveniences my decision might cause.
