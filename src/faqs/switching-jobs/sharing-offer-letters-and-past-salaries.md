## Perspectives & advice from the community

`u/Lord_TrainBacker7000` on a post titled, [Is it okay for me to share my offer letter with a recruiter?](https://www.reddit.com/r/developersIndia/comments/v32lvo/is_it_okay_for_me_to_share_my_offer_letter_with_a/)
shared the following advice:

<blockquote>

Hi Recruiter,

The offer letter I have signed has a confidentiality clause and I would not be
comfortable in sharing the same. I would be able to share the compensation
breakup if that solves the purpose. (Or any other similar variation)

Best regards,

Your awesome self

`u/Infinitrix02` on a post titled, [I'm tired of being asked about my current and expected CTC](https://www.reddit.com/r/developersIndia/comments/qnvk1d/im_tired_of_being_asked_about_my_current_and/) shared the following advice:

<blockquote>

If a recruiter ever asks for your expected salary in the first call, say these
lines:

"Would it be alright if I told you my expected salary at the end stage of the
interview?"

Most the times the recruiters will comply with this. But in certain cases the
recruiter will ask why. In that case, you should say this:

"I believe that once I complete the interviews and ask some questions regarding
the role as well, I will have a more accurate range to provide you with. Without
proper knowledge of this role, I don't think it's fair for me to give a number
that doesn't justify the role."

Which is all bullshit. We already have a number in our mind. But still say these
lines because by the time the salary negotiation stage arrives, the recruiters
are in too deep to let you go (if you have performed well on the interviews).
However, this doesn't mean that the company will give you any salary that you
desire. There will be some negotiation for sure. Therefore make sure that you
give a realistic number too.

Finally, if the recruiters are still persistent and say something like:
"Actually in order for me to present your profile to the management, I need some
range or number." In these cases, give them a wide (and I mean extremely wide)
range.

Say you're earning 5 LPA right now, say something like 7 - 14 LPA.

I don't earn 5LPA (yet) so I haven't tried out the last solution, but the first
two have worked beautifully for me over the past year.

`u/pablolit69` on a post titled, [Recruiter: What's your current CTC? How to respond?](https://www.reddit.com/r/developersIndia/comments/xhiz2b/recruiter_whats_your_current_ctc_how_to/)
shared the following advice:

<blockquote>

Don't try to avoid them.

Tell that you earn 5 LPA, and that you are expecting 10-12 LPA. It's not as rare
as they will make it sound like.

Let them stick to their script, you stick to yours.

But yes, you can always decline to tell your expected CTC before the interviews.
For that, you can say that you don't know their pay range, and your expectations
will be according to that. If they can tell you the range, you can tell the
expectation now. Else, it will take time for you to get an idea about how much
their company pays

At least that's what I do. If they insist, I always tell them that I do not have
any fixed number in mind, and if they keep insisting, I get done with saying
"industry standard hike". Later, after the interview, if they insist that the
industry standard is 25%, I insist that for the role that I am applying to and
based on the company, it's 100%. (Don't just say it, unless it's true)

It's not that there's some official resource that they can quote, and tell me
that I am wrong.

Do tell them your current CTC, as it saves everyone some time. But keep the
"expected CTC" part for later.
