# Planning for Resignation

## Perspectives & Advice from the community

_u/magnet\_24_ on a post titled [Resignation Reason Backfired](https://www.reddit.com/r/developersIndia/comments/15gwfph/resignation_reason_backfired/) shared the following advice:

<blockquote>

OP, just vomit out the below phrase word for word :

"Unfortunately upon further introspection i have come to the conclusion that resigning would be the better trajectory for my career path."

And, whatever they say after this, keep mum, answer in only "hmmms" and "i see" and stick to your decision. They may try to provocate, do not engage.

And as a general rule of thumb, it rarely benefits to accept a counter offer.
